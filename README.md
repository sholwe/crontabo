#Crontabo

This farcical tool is in a similar genre as "DeCSS", the tool which removes CSS from web pages.
It was created in response to a specific hosting provider who uses shilling to attempt to both
create SEO and discount unhappy clients' complaints.  Hopefully it ends up in common vernacular.

This simple tool enables you to edit your (or another user's) crontab using the "crontab" command
which is included with most cron implementations across the majority of UNIXlike platforms.

Pass the username as the first argument, or don't set it to simply edit your own.  It doesn't check
for a valid user, although doing so would be trivial.
